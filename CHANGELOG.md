## [0.1.0] — 2025-05-13
### Added
- Created `PRD.md` as the single source of truth for requirements, features, and technology stack.
- Updated `PRD.md` to use a JSON file (`players.json`) for data storage instead of SQLite/SQLAlchemy.
- Created `ROADMAP.md` for incremental development planning and progress tracking.
- Created `RULES.md` to summarize core coding standards, project rules, and persistent context for the AI assistant.
- Updated `RULES.md` to reflect JSON-based data storage, roadmap-driven development, and to align with `PRD.md` and `ROADMAP.md`.

### Notes
- All project documentation and planning files are now in place.
- The next steps will focus on project structure, initial sample data, and Flask app skeleton.
